# A simple term rewriting system with Mathematica's syntax

After reading about the book [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).
I decide to write a simple Mathematica interpreter to learn more about Haskell.



Running:
```
  git clone https://github.com/jyh1/mmaclone.git
  cd mmaclone/mmaclone
  stack setup
  stack build
  stack exec mmaclone-exe
```
